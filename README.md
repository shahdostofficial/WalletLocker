# WalletLocker
The TimeLock smart contract is designed to allow the owner to lock funds for a specific duration and then withdraw them after the lock time has elapsed. The contract is implemented in Solidity version 0.8.0. It includes a lockTime variable to specify the duration of the lock period, and a startTime variable to keep track of when the funds were locked. The onlyBy modifier ensures that only the specified account can access certain functions. The withdraw function allows the owner to transfer the locked funds to their address only if the lock time has passed. The contract also includes a receive function to handle incoming payments.
